# rekwestbin

Hey yall, welcome to our **rekwestb√Øn** project repo! The only reason the 'i' in the repo title doesn't have a diaeresis (had to look it up) above it, is because github only accepts ASCII characters in repo names. But rest assured, we are keeping our original project name. 

We all have admin rights for our organization "Team3-Counterpoint". ~~Merge request rules are set so that at least 1 member has to approve.~~ It appears we can only set merge rules on public repos with our free org account. This rekwestbin repo is currently set to private, but I think that might have limited features available compared to a public repo. If we find that public works better, we can easily change the visibility. 

I figure going forward we will continue to use Team3-Counterpoint as our overarching 'organization' and just create new repos for new projects. We are obviously a democracy here, so any proposed changes are always up for debate.  

Cheers,
T

p.s. 
The 'demo-repository' listed in our organization seems like a good tutorial resource.
